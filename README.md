This is a project 5 in Udacity for Front End Web Developer nanodegree course.

This is a single-page application featuring a map of restaurants and bistro bars in Vancouver, BC Canada. 
Application works with Foursquare and Google Map API.

When the application is loaded, user can see the list of popular places in Vancouver area in a table, called "Favorite Loations".
On a map there are makeers, that represent each of location from the list.

In order to filter given locations, user can type a keyword in a search field and press the search button.

Also there is an option to choose any location from the table and click on it. The infowindow will pop up with the name, phone number and address of a chosen place. All the markers are replaced from the map. The table shows only highlighted location.

If a user wants to return application to a default state, few actions are required.
1. Close the popup information window.
2. Clear the search field and to press search button.

Few words for improvement:
There is a wide gap to improve functionality and style of provided application) 
For example: to add a field where the user can set up the neihbourhood by clicking on a point on a map.
